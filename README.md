## Neutron

Neutron has been rewritten based on Nuclei 2.7, removing all dependencies (only depends on logs and utils from the chainreactors project, with no recursive dependencies, and is extremely small in size), and trimmed features that are less likely to be used in internal networks, resulting in a nano Nuclei engine.
